##KTH-ID1212-project Client side application

### Running environment
Please do not use Chrome. 
The web app should run well on firefox and Edge. Not sure about other browsers.
In order to run on firefox and Edge, you first need to access https://localhost:10086/hello 
and trust the certificate (which should be alerted as unsafe, but it is actually
can be trustable from us). Then you can access to localhost:8088/login to login or register.
